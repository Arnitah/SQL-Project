# SQL-Project
This portfolio showcases a collection of SQL projects demonstrating my proficiency in querying datasets and executing various SQL commands. The projects highlight my ability to manipulate data, perform complex queries, and extract valuable insights from multiple datasets.
This SQL script is designed to analyze data related to rubrics, course sections, and overall recommendations from a database containing information about course sections and rubric assessments. The script uses three Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract and organize data for both analytic and holistic rubric types, as well as overall feedback for students.
