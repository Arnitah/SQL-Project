# SQL-Project
This SQL script is designed to analyze data related to rubrics, course sections, and overall recommendations from a database containing information about course sections and rubric assessments. The script uses three Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract and organize data for analytic and holistic rubric types and overall feedback for students.
